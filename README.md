A Discord.py Rewrite "Song of the day" command that utilises the user's spotify status or a specified link to submit their song of the day to a channel specified by the bot developer :)

-I've included some error handlers in the file, they are optional.

-The command has a 12 hour cooldown by default but you can change that if you want.
